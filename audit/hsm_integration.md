# HSM Integration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the integration of Hardware Security Modules (HSM) with the Mustang secure communication framework.

## Supported HSM Vendors

- AWS CloudHSM
- Google Cloud HSM
- Azure Key Vault HSM

## Integration Steps

1. Provision HSM instance with required cryptographic capabilities.
2. Configure network and access policies for secure communication.
3. Generate and import cryptographic keys into HSM.
4. Modify Mustang backend to use HSM for JWT signing and key management.
5. Implement key rotation policies aligned with compliance requirements.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure HSM access is restricted to authorized services.
- Monitor HSM usage and audit logs regularly.
- Use hardware-backed key storage for critical secrets.

## Troubleshooting

- Connectivity issues: Verify firewall and VPC settings.
- Performance bottlenecks: Monitor HSM throughput and scale accordingly.
